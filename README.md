# U1: ISPO
## U1 CW2: Knock Knock Variations
### Exploration Questions

1. How does "Simple" work? **You click on it, then you get a message that says "knock knock", then if you click ok, it will say "wooden shoe", and if you click ok, it leaves a final message that says "wooden shoe like to know"**
2. How does "Better" improve it? **If you click better, you will get the same "knock knock" message again, if you do or don't type anything the message will still say "wooden shoe" but this time if you do or don't type, it will actually say "Huh?"**
3. What do the "Global Variables" have to do with this? ****
4. How does "Best" improve it more? **You will get the same messages as Better, but except on this one, you can't really close out of the messages, they will actually restart with the knock knock joke, then it's "wooden shoe" and "Huh?" and it repeats.**
