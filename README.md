# U1: ISPO
## U1 CW2: Knock Knock Variations
### Exploration Questions

1. How does "Simple" work? **When you click "Simple" you are prompted with "knock knock" and a text box, by clicking "Ok" or "Cancel" (regardless of what is in the text box) you then are prompted with "wooden shoe" clicking "Ok" or "Cancel" then prompts "wooden shoe like to know!" which is where you can click the final "Ok" and get out of the chain.** 
2. How does "Better" improve it?
3. What do the "Global Variables" have to do with this? **The prompt chain of "knock knock" --> "wooden shoe" --> "wooden shoe like to know" are global variables that always pop up when you click any of the buttons.**
4. How does "Best" improve it more?
   
### Code Questions
5. What parts (line numbers) are "Output" (the computer writes something on the screen)? **the line numbers that write on the screen are the ones with prompt() (which also include a spot for input as well) commands and alert() commands and the function() commands -- so those are line numbers: 9, 10, 11, 16, 18, 19, 24, 27, 28 (which is a function,) 32, 34, and 35 (which make up said function.)**
6. What parts (line numbers) are "Input" (you have to type something?)
7. What parts (line numbers) are "Storage" (the computer holds on to what you write - look at "Better" **the if() statements are what "hold on" to what you are saying, or rather they compare what you're saying with what the computer been told needs to be said. These are found in lines: 18, 27, and 34 (which is apart of the function that keeps you there until you answer correctly.)**
8. What parts (line numbers) are "Processing" (the computer makes a decision to affect what it does)?
9. How does "Best" handle repeat guessing? What's the "word" that refers to a function calling itself? **"Best" handles repeat guessing by including an else statement that outputs a recursive function (recursion being the word for when a function calls itself) that only stops calling itself when you answer correctly** 
10. Fist to Five:  How well did you understand what we talked about today? **4**
